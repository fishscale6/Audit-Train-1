# Solidity Audit - First Audit

## Overview

This is the report of my first Solidity audit, which was conducted on a smart contract project. I performed this audit after completing the **Cyfrin Updraft Solidity Audit Course**, where I gained insights into smart contract security, best practices, and common vulnerabilities.

The objective of this audit was to evaluate the codebase for potential security risks, inefficiencies, and vulnerabilities. The audit followed industry-standard best practices, utilizing both manual inspection and automated tools.
